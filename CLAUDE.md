# brother_ql

A Python library and CLI for Brother QL label printers (a luxardolabs fork of pklaus/brother_ql). Library kind: `src/brother_ql/`, no service and no container image.

- **Docs:** `README.md` and `docs/` (usage, API, development). `docs/development.md` covers the make targets and the Docker-only workflow.
- **Gate:** `make check` (every guard, in Docker). `make onboard-check` proves the guards are wired and honest.
- **Release:** `/release` (`.claude/skills/release/SKILL.md`), the library ritual: SemVer `VERSION`, root `CHANGELOG.md`, `v<VERSION>` tag, GitHub Release.

## How to work here (fleet conduct — read the standard, not just this block)

**`luxarch --doc FLEET-AGENT-CONDUCT-STANDARD` — read it in full before your first change.** It is the one home for *how* agents work in this fleet. This block is a pointer plus the handful of rules that get broken most; it is not a summary and does not replace reading it.

**Report the result, not the mountain.** No "heavy", "multi-hour", "the big one", no narrating difficulty. Done + next in one line, with numbers.

**Decide; do not hand back a menu.** Whether to ask the owner is decided by the **class of action**, never by how confident you feel:

- **Ask** — deleting anything; changing scope; a deferral/allowlist/exemption; publishing outward (pushing another repo, a force-push, a history rewrite); a genuine product fork where the choice is taste, not correctness.
- **Do it** — aligning code to a ratified standard or a guard red; anything you have evidence for that is reversible in one commit. The standard already decided; say what you did.

When you do ask: **one decision per message**, the evidence that makes it answerable, your recommendation stated as one, and a question answerable in one word. **A recommendation that ends in a menu is not a recommendation** — if you rejected the alternatives, re-offering them asks the owner to redo your analysis.

**Use the fleet skills; don't improvise the procedure.** `/wrap-up` before you call anything done (tests, every red in touched files, docs, gate, LuxPM closed out, all with evidence). `/pin-bump` to upgrade the guards. `/escalate` when a guard is wrong. `/release` to cut a release.

**You touched it, you own it.** Edit a file for any reason and it has a mypy, ruff or luxarch red: fix every one in that file, not just yours. Never spend time proving a red predates you; fix it. Test what you changed first. **Before fixing any mypy red, read `luxlint --playbook mypy-sweep` in full.**

**Align or escalate; never route around.** A guard red is fixed by changing the code, or escalated to the guard maintainer as genuinely wrong. Never by an exemption, a `# noqa`, a deferral, or a local config. Verification is not authorization: proving something is unreferenced does not license deleting it.

**Escalations go in THIS repo's LuxPM project** — label `fleet-escalation`, title `[<guard> ESCALATION] …`, self-contained enough to forward whole. **Search LuxPM for an existing issue first** (and comment on it if found); filing a new one is pre-authorized. **Never a GitHub issue** — there is no fallback. The maintainer sweeps the label across every project and picks it up where you filed it.

**A red stays RED while its escalation is open.** The fleet does not gate CI on red. A lit red is honest; a silenced one is a lie you will inherit.

**Commit as `luxardolabs`** using the global git config, and never `git -c user.email=…`. No AI attribution in commit messages.
